# Room Value Estimator

This example fetches the marketplace information of all furni in a room to calculate its estimated
total value in credits. It uses the `RoomManager` to track the state of all furni in the room, the
`GameDataManager` to fetch furni data and obtain furni names, and the `GetMarketplaceInfoMsg`
request message to asynchronously request the marketplace information of each group of furni in the
room.

## How to run

Connect to a hotel via G-Earth, change into this directory and run `dotnet run` to build and run the
extension, wait for the game data to load, then enter a room and activate the extension by pressing
the green play button in G-Earth. You should see the average price of each furni fetched from the
marketplace, multiplied by the number of that furni in the room:
